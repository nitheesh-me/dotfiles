## Getting started

you can use the [convenience script](./scripts/install_doctfiles.sh) to install the dotfiles on any machine with a single command. Simple run the following command in your terminals:

```bash
sh -c "$(get -q0- https://git.io/nitheesh-dotfiles)"
```

> ðŸ’¡ We use `wget` here because it comes preinstalled with most Ubuntu versions. But you can also use `curl`:
>
> ```bash
>  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/nitheesh-dotfiles)"
> ```
